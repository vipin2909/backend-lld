A concept is not a real world entity
it has no attributes or any real specific behaviours

Animal is someone who can run, eat and walk.

if any entity supports a specific set of behaviours, i can categorise the entity as that concept.

INTERFACES: Blueprints of these behaviours

interface Animals {
    void run();
    void eat();
    void walk();
}

whenever we are implementing any interface then we have to define all its methods inside the
class which is implementing interface.

System must be loosely coupled not tight coupled

(A tight coupling refers to a situation where two or more software components are closely connected
and dependent on each other to function properly)


Abstract Class:
any child class of abstract class is forces to implement all abstract methods.
we can't make an object of abstract class.


Why is multiple inheritance not allowed in java ?

Due to Diamond problem
A
B extends A
C extends A
D extends B, C

Java class loader memory:
which is responsible for storing the classes
When ever i make variable static it no longer belongs to object it will go to class in loader memory
and the attribute continues to stay in class memory
