Three pillars of OOPS
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

1 Principle of OOP: Abstraction
Abstraction: Others don't need to know about the ideas of implementation details


Encapsulation:
1) store the attributes & the behaviours of an entity together
2) Protected the attributes and behaviours from illegitimate access


Class: Blueprint/template of an entity idea

A class is a structure of idea
-class occupies no space
-not a real/tangible entity
-multiple instance can be created of the same class

Objects-> Actual instances of class
-will occupy memory in app

// Each object is complete seprate
