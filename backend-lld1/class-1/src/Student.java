// OOP

// 1. Software should revolve around entities
// 2. Each entity has its own attributes (info) & also has its own behaviours.

// Example of a student entity

public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    String gender;

    void print() {
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + name);
    }
}
