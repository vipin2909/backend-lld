We do encapsulation to achieve Abstraction

ACCESS MODIFIERS
keywords: which are used to restrict access of class members (Attributes + Methods)

1) Public: Anybody can access
2) Private: Only same class, nobody outside the class can access
3) Protected: All classes within package + ONLY subclasses outside package
4) Default: All classes within package.


Default Constructor:

if we don't create a constructor of our own a default constructor is created.
This creates a new obj. of this class & sets the default value of the attributes.
(Unless Provided).

Copy Constructor
-We already have an object
-We want to create new object with all the values same as existing object

Types of data in java -> Primitive & Object
1) primitive -> char, int, float, boolean
2) Object -> got stored in heap memory


Shallow copy
Where i have created a copy of object but behind the scenes
Means passed object as a variable in another object

Ex. Student:
{
name,
age,
address: {city, state, street}
}

s1 = {"ABC", 10, {"Chandigarh", "Haryana", "29"}}

s2 = new Student(s1);
s1.address.city = "Kanina";

so println(s2.address.city) // Kanina


DESTRUCTOR: opp of constructor
will automatically called after the object is no longer needed(i.e once its work is done
mostly seeing in languages with pointer
will be called in class when obj does not automatically free up the memory
In modern languages such as java, once an object is no longer needed,
garbage collectors automatically gets run and frees up memory
