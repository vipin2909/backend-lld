Semaphores: mutex locks with count
example suppose we are dealing with store producer consumer

suppose store data has common shared data between customer and producer, so it becomes critical section
with help of mutex locks and synchronized methods we can handle it but at a time only one producer and one
consumer can access and update data

so for that case and to optimize further we can use semaphores

Semaphore s = new Semaphore(count);

The idea of semaphore is to allow multiple thread to execute their critical section simultaneously
means: multiple section to execute their critical section at one time
